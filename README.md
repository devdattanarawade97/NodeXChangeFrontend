## Overview

This is a comprehensive README document for the frontend project. The project is built using React, JavaScript, and various dependencies to provide a robust and scalable frontend infrastructure.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

* `public`: Contains static assets, such as images, icons, and the manifest file.
* `src`: Contains the main application code, including components, containers, and utilities.
* `components`: Contains reusable React components, such as `LeftPanel`, `ChatInterface`, and `Header`.
* `containers`: Contains higher-order components that wrap around other components to provide additional functionality.
* `utils`: Contains utility functions and constants used throughout the application.

## Components

The project uses the following components:

* `LeftPanel`: A sidebar component that contains navigation links and other interactive elements.
* `ChatInterface`: A component that renders the chat interface, including the input field, conversation history, and file upload functionality.
* `Header`: A component that renders the application header, including the title, navigation links, and other interactive elements.

## Functionality

The project provides the following functionality:

* User authentication and authorization
* Chat interface with file upload and conversation history
* Navigation and routing between different sections of the application
* Integration with Arweave for file storage and retrieval

## Dependencies

The project depends on the following packages:

* `react`: For building the user interface and handling state changes.
* `react-dom`: For rendering the React components to the DOM.
* `react-helmet`: For managing the document head and meta tags.
* `arweave`: For interacting with the Arweave blockchain and storing files.
* `material-icons`: For using Material Design icons in the application.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.

## Build and Deployment

To build and deploy the project, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm build` or `yarn build` to create a production-ready build of the application.
2. Deploy the build to a hosting platform, such as Vercel or Netlify.
